## README

In this project, we will explore a time course gene expression dataset from Paul Spellman's lab at Stanford. 
This microarray dataset contains transcript levels from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, 
which respond to various cyclins, reflecting different stages of the cell cycle. Specifically, we will focus 
on the cdc15 time course experiment and conduct various data analysis and visualization tasks using R. 
We will also create a Shiny web application to interactively explore gene expression patterns across different time points.
